# Scales -- First Machine Learning project for practice

The dataset here is about measurements of distance and weight for each side of the scale.

The task is to create a predictive model that essentially predicts whether the scales is in a state of having either side (i.e. left or right) tipped up or in balance.

To set it up and running in traditional way:

```shell
virtualenv venv
sourve venv/bin/activate
pip install -f requirements.txt
.....
```

Or the the conda way:
```shell
echo Needs to be written!!!!
```

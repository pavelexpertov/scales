# Problem Definition

## What is the problem?
There's a dataset that represents whether scales are tipping up to the left side or right side or they are in balance. They are represented based on a categorical class and associated attributes of weights and distances on each side of the scales.

The problem is to determine what category the scale is in based on weights and distances of each side.

# Why does the problem need to be solved?
The motivation behind this problem is to use current knowledge of data analysis and machine learning algorithms that specialise in multi-classification in data.

As for the built predictive model, it will help to instantly determine position of scales based on readings of weight and distance of each side.

# How would I solve the problem?
It it was a manual solution, I would have chosen to read the distance between the scale's and ground for each side and then determine range of distances that would make the scale balance. Then just write a comparison logic to make a program to spit out in which state the scales are in.
